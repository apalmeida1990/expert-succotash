# First Exercise

**Notes:**

1. Implemented two versions of the request:
   1. One using `os.walk` function, which  walks the directory tree either top-down or bottom-up.
   2. Rudimentar implementation of `os.walk` using a recursive approach.
2. Added some `pytest` tests. Nothing too complex, just some quick assetions
