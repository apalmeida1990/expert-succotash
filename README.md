# cocus_assignment

Repository with Cocus Data Engineer opening challenge implementation.

**Notes:**

You can check on [src](src/) folder all the exercises requested.

I added some bonus:

- like a docker container
- a `makefile` which allows a quicker interaction with command-line
- a simple github-actions CI/CD pipeline, which runs a few pytest commands.
- and others

By typing `make run` on your cli you'll spin up a docker container with all the dependencies installed and test the code.
